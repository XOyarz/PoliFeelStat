Detectives have made "immense" progress in the investigation into the Manchester bombing and are confident they have arrested some "key players", Britain's top counter-terror officer has said.

Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said police have made "significant" arrests and "finds" and have got hold of a "large part of the network" being sought over the atrocity.

Mr Rowley said: "They are very significant, these arrests.

"We are very happy we've got our hands around some of the key players that we are concerned about but there's still a little bit more to do."

Fresh raids were carried earlier today&nbsp;as security services brace&nbsp;for more attacks during the Muslim holy month of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ramadan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ramadan</a>&nbsp;beginning tomorrow.

Islamic State has called on its followers to rise up in an “all-out war” on "infidels” in the West.&nbsp;Saturday marks the start of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/what-is-ramadan-and-when-is-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">30-day period of fasting and reflection</a> in the Islamic world, which has in recent years seen a large increase in terror attacks.

As detectives revealed the youngest man in custody over the Manchester attack is 18, early-hours searches were on Friday&nbsp;launched at a Manchester barbershop and a takeaway on&nbsp;Merseyside.

Officers who earlier raided terrorist Salman Abedi's home <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/25/manchester-attack-fears-second-bomb-police-find-huge-chemical/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">discovered a working bomb factory</a> with a huge stash of explosive chemicals and other components.

It comes amid fears the attacker might have built a&nbsp;second device that is now in the hands of fellow jihadists.

Security sources now believe he assembled the bomb himself&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/23/manchester-libyan-connection-recruiting-ground-jihadists/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">after learning his trade in Libya</a>. But the amount of material in his home has led to fears that he could have built more than one device and and distributed them to other British-based extremists.

A&nbsp;security source told the Telegraph: "The worry is there was enough to build two or three bombs and we can't rule that out."

Police today revealed that the eight men in custody "on suspicion of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act"&nbsp;in connection with Monday's atrocity, which<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/23/victims-manchester-terror-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> killed 22 people</a> - including seven children - are aged between 18 and 38.

Meanwhile, with the General Election campaign resuming, Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestion that Britain’s involvement in military action abroad is linked to the Manchester attack has been<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/26/jeremy-corbyn-condemned-crass-appalling-timing-speech-linking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">&nbsp;condemned as “twisted reasoning”&nbsp;</a>by the Security Minister.

British police have resumed "working closely" with US authorities on the probe after a tense showdown between the allies over leaked intelligence.

After Theresa May warned the transatlantic row risked hampering the "special relationship" between the UK and America, US Secretary of State is making his first official trip to Britain today.

With Britain on critical alert, stay with us for the latest updates today amid the&nbsp;huge operation to dismantle a suspected "network" linked to Abedi.

A spike in hate crime has hit Manchester in the wake of Monday's suicide bombing, Greater Manchester Police say.

A total of 56 hate crimes were recorded by the force on Wednesday, a significant rise on the 28 reported on Monday.

Chief constable &nbsp;Ian Hopkins said: "Whilst we can't directly link this to the events of Monday night, we are continuing to monitor the situation and support our communities."

"Manchester has come together this week, the public has seen that, they have seen that compassion.

"But it is important that we continue to stand together here, in Greater Manchester.

"Particularly standing together against some of the hateful views that we have seen from a very small minority of the community that have no place here in Greater Manchester."

He added: "I have sent a personal message out to all the faith leaders and places of worship today and have thanked them for the support they have shown and stressed that hate crime will not be tolerated."

Amir Khan, the boxer, is among those who travelled to Manchester today to leave floral tributes to the victims under the watch of armed police officers.

Manchester Cathedral, within the cordon since Monday evening, reopened on Thursday and is offering visitors the chance to sign a book of condolence and light a candle in memory of those who died.

In St Ann's Square, boxer Khan said: "I just wanted to come here and show my respects.

"Obviously it's a very sad time for Manchester. I have to say, the people of Manchester are very brave and we all have to stick together and get through things like this.

"I believe in the people of Manchester, they're very strong and we just have to all stick together.

"I've come here to show my respects and I can't believe the amount of people I have met here who are here for the same reason as me, showing their respects and laying flowers down."

Danielle Anderson, 36, who came to lay flowers with sister Simone Anderson, 32, said the city seemed busier on Friday than it was earlier in the week.

She said: "We came to town yesterday and it was the weirdest atmosphere, nobody was talking, everybody looked sad and everybody was quiet. It didn't feel right.

"Today it does feel different, it's a lot busier. Yesterday, you could hear a pin drop."

Najma Khalid came to lay flowers with members of the Women's Chai Project.

She said: "We just want to stand together and tell Manchester we love them and we are praying for the victims. This is not going to divide us. Life carries on and we're standing united."&nbsp;

Hundreds of tourists have watched the Changing of the Guard ceremonies at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.

The popular events were <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/24/troops-deployed-british-streets-manchester-terror-attack-pictures/buckingham-palace-will-one-sites-protection-army-today-changing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cancelled on Wednesday</a> in the wake of the Manchester attack to allow police officers, who would have been controlling road closures, to be re-deployed.

But a Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said the colourful spectacles, that attract large crowds to the Queen's official London home and her Berkshire castle, would go ahead as scheduled.

In bright summer sunshine, visitors to the capital watched as F Company the Scots Guards marched to replace the Buckingham Palace old guard of the Queen's Colour Squadron, RAF.

The spokeswoman said a rehearsal for Trooping the Colour - also known as the Queen's Birthday Parade - which was due to be held today had been moved to next Wednesday.

She said: "This decision has been taken by General Officer Commanding London District as preparations were ahead of schedule.

"We take these rehearsals for Queen's Birthday Parade very seriously to ensure we are able to equal and even exceed the standards of excellence expected for this important and high-profile annual event."

In January, it was confirmed Changing the Guard was switching to fixed days in the autumn and winter after security was stepped up in the wake of the Berlin terror attack.

Enhanced policing and security will also be in place for Saturday's Scottish Cup Final at Hampden Park in Glasgow.

Police Scotland are asking ticket holders for the match between Celtic and Aberdeen to arrive early to allow for checks, and to not take bags into the stadium.

Superintendent Mark Hargreaves, match commander for the event, said: "Whilst I understand that some people may be inconvenienced by the increased security, public safety is our priority and I am sure everyone in Scotland will co-operate with us and support this.

"There is no specific threat against Scotland, or the Scottish Cup Final; however, people should remain calm but vigilant and report anything suspicious to police."

Speaking on his first official visit to the UK, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US took "full responsibility" for and "regrets" the leaking of information from the Manchester bombing.

A row erupted between the US and British authorities after a host of sensitive information, including photographs from the scene of the attack, was leaked to American news outlets in the wake of Monday's attack.

Mr Tillerson said: "This special relationship that exists between our two countries will certainly withstand this particular unfortunate event."

European security services are bracing for more attacks during the Muslim holy month of <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ramadan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ramadan </a>beginning tomorrow, after Islamic State called on its followers to rise up in an “all-out war” on "infidels” in the West, reports&nbsp;Middle East Correspondent <strong>Josie Ensor</strong> in Beirut.

Saturday marks the start of a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/what-is-ramadan-and-when-is-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">30-day period of fasting and reflection</a> in the Islamic world, which has in recent years seen a large uptick in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/islamic-state/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Islamic State</a> of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) terror attacks.

“Muslim brothers in Europe who can’t reach the Islamic State lands, attack them in their homes, their markets, their roads and their forums,” the jihadist group said in a message entitled Where are the lions of war? and published on YouTube.

Defending themselves after the suicide attack on Manchester Arena, which left 22 mostly children and teenagers dead, the group said: “Do not despise the work. Your targeting of the so-called innocents and civilians is beloved by us and the most effective, so go forth and may you get a great reward or martyrdom in Ramadan.”

Last year, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the late Isil spokesman, issued a call to arms to followers to carry out lone wolf attacks during the holy month. It was the bloodiest Ramadan month on record.

Isil took credit for a lone jihadist gunman, an Afghan American who perpetrated America’s deadliest mass shooting in history and worst terrorism on US soil since 9/11 during early morning hours of June 12 at an&nbsp;Orlando gay nightclub, killing 49 and wounding 53.

An Islamist jihadist then stabbed a police officer and his wife in a Paris suburb in front of their son. The killer explicitly claimed in a live broadcast of the murder that he was responding to Adnani’s call.

Later that month, three Isil suicide bombers opened fire then blew themselves up at Istanbul’s main airport, killing 45 and wounding more than 250.

The final global body count after the month-long rampage was 421 dead and 729 wounded.

Hitting multiple targets in many different countries is designed to send the message that no person on earth is safe or can be protected from terrorism.

Speaking after chairing a meeting of the Government's emergency Cobra committee, Home Secretary Amber&nbsp;Rudd disclosed that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre has assessed that the terror threat level should remain at critical while the "live" police operation continues.

The rating was raised to critical, the highest level, for the first time in a decade in the wake of the Manchester outrage. It indicates that an attack may be imminent.

The owner of a shop next door to a barbershop raided by armed police overnight in Moss Side said the premises involved has not opened since Monday's suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena.

It is understood that an armed response unit arrived at the Fade Away shop in Princess Road in the early hours of Friday and that the shutter to the barbershop was cut open at about 5.15am to gain access to the front door.

A cordon was then placed around the building at 6am and stretched&nbsp;to an adjoining chemist, cafe and upstairs flats.&nbsp;The cordon was lifted at 10.40am.

A marked police van is parked outside the store next to a bus stop with a number of uniformed officers guarding the cordon.

West Indian-born Byron Gibbs, 79, who has run Gibbs Hardware for the past 33 years, said that the shop next door had opened about 12 months ago.

He said a number of men appeared to work there but had never come into his shop to buy anything.

He said: "I never go there to talk to them, I don't have my hair cut there.&nbsp;Everyone round here has noticed that the shop has not opened since Monday and they usually open every day, including Sundays."

Mr Gibbs said he had recognised the face of suicide bomber Abedi from the television.

He said: "I have seen him a few times just walking past in the street. I don't know if he used this barbershop or he is involved with anyone there.

"We're all shocked around here about what happened on Monday and how close we are to all this. You don't know who these people are."

Earlier, Greater Manchester Police said they were searching a property in Moss Side in connection with Monday's attack and had also arrested a man in the area.

A spokesman said: "The search is being carried out at a separate property to the address where a man was arrested earlier this morning."

Greater Manchester Police have provided the first full breakdown of the arrests made in the huge investigation to establish whether there was a "network" behind Salman Abedi's suicide attack.

Counter-terror detectives have revealed eight suspects aged between 18 and 38 are in custody in connection with the Manchester bombing.

In total 10 individuals were detained between Tuesday and Friday. All were held "on suspicion of offences contrary to the Terrorism Act".

A 16-year-old boy arrested in Withington on Thursday and a 34-year-old woman arrested In Blackley on Wednesday have been released without charge.

Jeremy Corbyn’s suggestion that Britain’s involvement in military action abroad is linked to terror attacks like the Manchester suicide bomb has been<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/26/jeremy-corbyn-condemned-crass-appalling-timing-speech-linking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> condemned as “twisted reasoning” </a>by the Government’s Security Minister.

Mr Corbyn will deliver a speech in London this morning in which he will point to "the connections between wars the Government has supported or fought in other countries and terrorism here at home".

But Ben Wallace said the timing of Mr Corbyn’s speech is “appalling” and “crass” as he&nbsp;rejected the idea that there is a link between UK foreign policy and terror.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’m sitting here in Manchester, a place where 21 years ago the IRA detonated a bomb that injured 212 people.

“That was the last terrorist act in Manchester. They are all terrorists. We have to be unequivocal that no amount of excuses, no amount of twisted reasoning about a foreign policy here or a foreign policy there can be an excuse.

“The reality is these people hate our values. You only have to look at their propaganda to realise.”

A former independent terror watchdog has said it was a "grave mistake" to abolish <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11051120/QandA-Terror-controls-explained.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">control orders</a> to monitor terrorism suspects.

Lord Carlile said the sweeping powers "may have saved dozens of lives" between 2005 and 2011.

The independent peer and top QC also urged Theresa May to use their replacements "to their full effect now", with just a handful of people currently subject to terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIMs).

Control orders restricted the freedom of terrorism suspects and could be used to force people to move or restrict their use of phones and computers.

But they were abolished by the coalition government in 2012 amid concerns over their impact on civil liberties. Lord Carlile told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:

TPIMs place restrictions on those suspected of being involved in terrorism, but where there is not enough evidence to charge or deport them.

Just seven people are subject to TPIMs at the moment, Lord Carlile said, adding that they were "better than nothing".

Lord Carlile was previously a Liberal Democrat peer but quit the party given its stance on security issues.

A police cordon is in place around the Fade Away barbershop in Princess Road, Moss Side, after a police raid early today.

The shutters were down on the shop but part of it appeared to have been smashed open to gain access to the front door.&nbsp;A cordon was then placed around the building at 6am, which stretches to an adjoining chemist, cafe and upstairs flats.

A marked police van is parked outside the store next to a bus stop with a number of officers guarding the cordon.

The search is being carried out at a separate property to the address where a man was arrested earlier this morning.

A police spokesman said: "As it stands ten people in total have been arrested in connection with the investigation, of which a man and a woman have since been released without charge. Eight men remain in custody for questioning."

We've been hearing overnight that counter-terror police have carried out new&nbsp;raids in connection with the attack, searching addresses in Manchester and Merseyside.

One man was arrested in the Moss Side area of Manchester in the early hours of Friday morning and detectives searched a property in St Helens.

Eight men are in custody in connection with Monday's atrocity, with police and security agencies working at pace amid fears of further attacks.

Meanwhile, it is has emerged that police fear the Manchester bomber <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/25/manchester-attack-fears-second-bomb-police-find-huge-chemical/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">might&nbsp;have built a second device</a> that is now in the hands of fellow jihadists.

Officers who raided the home of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/salman-abedi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Salman Abedi</a>&nbsp;discovered a working bomb factory with a huge stash of explosive chemicals and other components.

Security sources now believe that Abedi assembled the bomb himself&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/23/manchester-libyan-connection-recruiting-ground-jihadists/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">after learning his trade in Libya</a>.

But the amount of material in his home has led to fears that he could have built more than one device and and distributed them to other British-based extremists.

Meanwhile, with the General Election campaign due to resume on Friday, Jeremy Corbyn has signalled his <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/25/jeremy-corbyn-suggests-britains-wars-abroad-blame-manchester/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">intention to bring the issue of terrorism into the political arena</a>.

The Labour leader is expected to make a veiled attack on the Conservatives for underfunding the police service at a time of heightened threat, while linking Britain's overseas military campaigns with terrorism at home.

On Thursday, UK police resumed "working closely" with US authorities on the probe after a <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/25/police-stop-sharing-information-us-intelligence-completely-unacceptable/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tense showdown between the allies</a> over leaked intelligence.

With Britain on critical alert, a huge operation is under way to dismantle a suspected "network" linked to suicide Abedi, who <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/23/victims-manchester-terror-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">killed 22 people </a>-&nbsp;seven of them under 18.

Mark Rowley, the UK's most senior counter-terrorism officer, confirmed British chiefs had "received fresh assurances" from their overseas counterparts that they could be trusted with confidential material.

Home Secretary Amber Rudd said she expected the "critical" assessment of the terror threat - suggesting a fresh attack may be imminent - to remain in place in the coming days.

Ms Rudd <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/26/amber-rudd-denies-police-cuts-blame-manchester-terror-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">told BBC1's Question Time</a>: "During this period of 'critical', which we hope will only last for a few days - it could be longer, it will depend on the operation - we've pulled out additional support from the Army so we can go about our normal life."

The developments followed a fraught day in which Greater Manchester Police severed intelligence-sharing ties with the US due to evidence being repeatedly passed to journalists without permission.

"While we do not usually comment on information-sharing arrangements with international law enforcement organisations, we want to emphasise that, having received fresh assurances, we are now working closely with our key partners around the world including all those in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance," Mr Rowley said.

Abedi, who was known to security services for his radical views, was said to have been in close contact with family members moments before slaughtering concert-goers on Monday.

A relative of the 22-year-old said he had felt increasing frustration at his treatment in the UK, heightened after a friend was fatally knifed in what he perceived to be a religious hate crime.

She added that the British-born bomber began referring to others in the country as "infidels" who were "unjust to Arabs".

Libyan authorities, who are questioning Abedi's parents and siblings,<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/26/manchester-bombersalman-abedi-asked-mother-forgiveness-hours/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> claimed he made a final phone call to his mother on the eve of the attack</a>, in which he said: "Forgive me."

Music fans were targeted at an Ariana Grande concert at Manchester Arena in the worst terrorist attack on British soil since the July 7 bombing in London in 2005.

As Abedi's route to mass murder continued to be probed:

At the Nato summit in Brussels, Theresa May confronted Donald Trump with her concerns about security lapses which allowed crucial evidence to be handed to US journalists by his officials.

He vowed to investigate, calling the leaks "deeply troubling" and warning the sources of the security lapse could be prosecuted.

In the years leading up to Monday's attack, it was said Abedi was known to security services, but his risk to the public remained "subject to review" and MI5 considered him a "former subject of interest", a Whitehall source said.

Police hunting the "network" behind his attack said they had made "significant" arrests and seized "very important" items in raids.

Emergency services on the night and aftermath of the Manchester attack were criticised by the widower of one victim, who accused them of leaving families in the dark.

Steve Howe, whose wife Alison, 45, died as she was waiting to collect their daughter from the concert, told Channel 4 News: "I gave them all the details, all the information from security in the arena, no-one has rang us... I was so frustrated."
